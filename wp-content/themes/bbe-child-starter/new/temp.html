At the airport and I read it.
I don't <em>hate</em> it but I highly disagree.
If you can't see why trans women would be offended by not being included in a march that white middle class women said was included, are we really allies?
And if we let micro-aggressions slide because 'well he didn't mean it that way,' then you have Trump.
The <em>little</em> things matter a lot <b>Andrew</b> and until we tackle them, we can never get to the big things.
Those are my initial thoughts.

the impulse to turn on everyone who doesn't manifest one's exact position is bullshit and generates nothing but in fighting. It's why we lose. Over and over. Because we're never unified.
No one forbad trans women form those marches. Some people chose to read some signs as hurting their feelings and therefore excluding them. It didn't.
We have to stop using protest to stage how right we are. It's the all or nothing attitude that makes me crazy. It's exactly the kind of politics as performance art which you were talking about.

I need to sit with this for a while.

OK

Marginalized people are tired of compromising their freedom so that well meaning white people can feel good about themselves.

<b>A.J.</b>

It's not about feeling good about anything. It's about moving forward. And how does a sign at a women's march advocating women's rights marginalize a trans person's freedom?

<b>Kerra</b>

Because it isn't about the sign. White middle class women said they were marching for women, except what they meant was they were marching for themselves.
They weren't marching for women of color, Muslim women, trans women or disabled women.
Good for white women. But I don't want them to claim to march or represent me. If they wanted to do that, they could have been at a black lives matter march. Oh wait. I forgot. My life doesn't matter unless it's in service to their aims.

<b>A.J.</b>

I don't know if that is true. It is, if nothing else, a sweeping statement that can't be true of all of them. You carry your sign for your issue. Doesn't mean you don't care about people with other issues

I am standing at baggage claim, which is sort of metaphoric for this conversation. But I am limited.
Let me appeal to the semiotician in you. Let's talk about two symbols of the march -- the pussy hats and the posters of women of color created by the white man who created the Obama Hope posters.
White women said these were symbols of unity without knowing what they meant. I don't know the expansion of your experience but not all pussies are pink and not all persons who identify as women have pussies.
Second was the Muslim drawing which many white women appropriated in social media and march signs. Many Muslim women said please don't use this image. Where we are from the American flag is a symbol of oppression. We would never wear it. If you want to support images of Muslim women, support art we make.
But this was ignored in the rush of 'you go girl! Let's be pissed because Hillary didn't win.'
So woc rightly concluded this isn't about us. You want us to unify. Unify and do what? Unify for whom? To the way things <em>used</em> to be? Well, they were bad for a lot of people. Unify because things will get much worse? You mean worse than slavery and Jim Crow?
You are talking to people who don't feel as if they have much to lose. So unifying will be difficult until you meet us where we are and be willing to be as uncomfortable as we have been as we have dealt with racism and discrimination.
You keep making it about a sign when it is about something much larger.
So much for sitting with this.
